My Dear Evelinne,

    It is during our darkest hours that we must focus and see the light. I believe the candle I write this letter by is my last. Is it foolish of me to think these words I write will ever meet your eyes? Very much so. The attacks have grown from petty thievery and the occasional killing to all out war. I have fought Orcs and Dragons alike in my time, and never have I come across an essence so evil. The Fallstar brothers are just the latest victims of their insatiable bloodlust, or shall I say, soul-lust. What is truly harrowing is that the countless victims they have taken were not blessed with a quick death. Their souls are trapped in limbo, within these beasts. Every time I slay one of them, I am not only taking their life, but I also am extinguishing the last small flames of life that are trapped inside. 

The food and provisions from Ravenhold ceased long ago. For all I know, they could be saving it for the pampered monarchs and lavish royalty. Or they could all be dead, who knows. On the rare occasion a traveler passes through, I make sure to ask about Silverport. My last salvation in this torment of a life is the hope that you are safe. Whatever happens, know that I am always with you, in life and in death. Will I lay down and accept my fate? Not as long as you walk this earth. After all, it is only in our darkest hours that we may discover the true strength of the brilliant light within ourselves that can never, ever, be dimmed.

    Love,
    Elric
