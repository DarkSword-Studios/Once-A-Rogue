Fifteenth Moon Of Ainor
Captive Observaton Log #5

Today is sadly the final day of prehumous observation of the subject. Almost giving up hope this morning, I attempted to conjure a potion that would act as a soul-restortant for the subject. I hoped that the inclusion of my own lifeblood would fill the soulless void of the subject and cause him to return to a normal state. The potion was conjured using my own blood and a vary of chemicals from around the lab, including Potentium, Arcanium, and Darskus, as well as a pinch of Earthroot and a dash of Morning Star. Upon sedation and oral administration of exactly one dosage of the concoction, the subject immediately rose from his quasi-unconscious state and immediately started writhing uncontrollably. After attempting to chew through his restraints, the subject was administered two additional doses of sedative. Moments after, the subject coughed up a purple substance before collapsing on the observation table. Minutes later, his heart ceased to beat. I believe my research has now reached a standstill. Tonight, I will dispose of the corpse. On the morrow, I will pack what reagents I can and set fire to the lab. Arcton is no longer the safe haven it once was. Apothecary Aidus McFerson, out.
