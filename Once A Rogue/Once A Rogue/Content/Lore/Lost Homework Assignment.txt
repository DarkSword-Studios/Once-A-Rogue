What is one task your father does that you also wish to do when you grow older?

My father woke every morning with a smile. Before he put on his armor, he looked at me and said, "Bobby, I am sorry I can not play this morning, but I have to do this." When Miriel told us that father had moved on, I cried for a long time. When I grow older, I am going to find father. I do not know where he moved to, but I know he is out there waiting for me.

What is one task your mother does that you also wish to do when you grow older?
    What mother?
