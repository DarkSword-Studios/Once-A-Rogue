Winter Season, 26th Fortnight, Sunrise:

I do not know what haunts me more. The diminishing supplies that will most certainly be gone by the end of season, or the decaying mental health of the men. The latter seems to have increased in seriousness over the past few nights. Burrick was not only one of the finest examples of an upstanding soldier, he was a shining example of a good man. It seems like just the other day when he mended my broken leg back to full health on one of our hunting trips. Through all my anguish, Burrick's selfless acts still resonate in my mind. Through the night when I couldn't sleep because of the pain, he sat up and sang to me. What a great voice he had. Soldier, singer, friend, and father. Even the strongest of men can not stand the conditions we are currently under. Last night, in a frenzied rage, Burrick took a chair to the back of fellow soldier Hans, causing him to fall and injure his head. Hans did not survive the night. All that over a piece of god damned bread. I do not know what to do. We are at a true end game, and I am just about out of pieces. After this life, I dream to go to a place where Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.
